callback is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned12 values; it is not invoked for indexes which have been deleted or which have never been assigned values. Array elements which do not pass the callback test are simply skipped, and are not included in the new array
The range of elements processed by filter is set before the first call to callbackfn. Elements which are appended to the array after the call to filter begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing elements of the array are changed their value as passed to callbackfn will be the value at the time filter visits them; elements that are deleted after the call to filter begins and before being visited are not visited
The range of elements processed by find is set before the first call to callbackfn. Elements that are appended to the array after the call to find begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing elements of the array are changed, their value as passed to predicate will be the value at the time that find visits them.
The engine applies optimizations on every stage of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it and applies optimizations to the machine code based on that knowledge. At the end, scripts are quite fast.
Engines are complicated But the basicss are easy.
filter() was added to the ECMA-262 standard in the 5th edition; as such it may not be present in all implementations of the standard. You can work around this by inserting the following code at the beginning of your scripts, allowing use of filter() in ECMA-262 implementations which do not natively support it. This algorithm is exactly equivalent to the one specified in ECMA-262, 5th edition, assuming that fn.call evaluates to the original value of Function.prototype.bind(), and that Array.prototype.push() has its original value.
callbackfn is called with four arguments: the previousValue (value from the previous call to callbackfn), the currentValue (value of the current element), the currentIndex, and the object being traversed. The first time that callback is called, the previousValue and currentValue can be one of two values. If an initialValue was provided in the call to reduce, then previousValue will be equal to initialValue and currentValue will be equal to the first value in the array. If no initialValue was provided, then previousValue will be equal to the first value in the array and currentValue will be equal to the second. It is a TypeError if the array contains no elements and initialValue is not provided.
